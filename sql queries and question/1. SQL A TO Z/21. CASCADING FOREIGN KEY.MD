# Cascading for FK

- On Delete Cascade
When we create a foreign key using this option, it deletes the referencing rows int the child table when the referenced row is deleted in the parent table which has a primary key.

- On Update Cascade
When we create a foreign key using UPDATE CASCADE the referencing rows are updated in the child table when the referenced row is update in the parent table which has a primary key.

```sql 
CREATE TABLE student(
   id INT PRIMARY KEY,
   courseID INT,
   FOREIGN KEY(courseID) REFERENCES course(id)
   ON DELETE CASCADE
   ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```
